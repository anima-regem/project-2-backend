00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.020
I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor.
That’s not my business.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.300
I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible -

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.140
Jew, Gentile - black man – white.
We all want to help one another.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.000
Human beings are like that.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.040
We want to live by each other’s
happiness - not by each other’s misery.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.000
We don’t want to hate and despise one another.
In this world there is room for everyone.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.640
And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.660
The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.180
Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.320
has goose-stepped us
into misery and bloodshed.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.420
We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.820
Machinery
that gives abundance has left us in want.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.509
Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness,
hard and unkind.

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:53.340
We think too much and feel too little.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.000
More than machinery we need humanity.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.460
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.760
Without these qualities, life
will be violent and all will be lost.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.220
The aeroplane and the radio have brought us
closer together.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.440
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men -

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.720
cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.660
Even now my voice is
reaching millions throughout the world -

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.880
millions of despairing men, women, and little children -

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.820
victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.160
To those who
can hear me, I say - do not despair.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.460
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed -

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.020
the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.220
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.780
and the power they took from the people will return to the people.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.479
And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.460
Soldiers! don’t give yourselves to brutes
- men who despise you - enslave you -

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.140
who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel!

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.420
Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.020
Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men -

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.560
machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.240
You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men!

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.420
You have the love of humanity in your hearts!

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.620
You don’t hate! Only the unloved
hate - the unloved and the unnatural!

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.040
Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.040
In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written:

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.760
“the Kingdom of God is within man” - not
one man nor a group of men, but in all men!

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.780
In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.480
The power to create happiness!

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.720
You, the people, have the power
to make this life free and beautiful,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.160
to make this life a wonderful adventure.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.760
Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.800
Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work -

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.560
that will give youth a future and old age a security.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.600
By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie!

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.560
They do not fulfil that promise.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.169
They never will! Dictators free themselves
but they enslave the people!

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:04.509
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world -

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:10.089
to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:16.900
Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.580
Soldiers! In the name of democracy, let us all unite!
